Welcome to the websites of the ARIEL space mission Data Analysis and Atmospheric retrieval working groups.
We have set up this page to facilitate documentation of our activities and to provide a platform to access data and code for the Data analysis and Retrieval data challenges.

The front page here will have updates on the project in the form of blog-posts such as this one.
